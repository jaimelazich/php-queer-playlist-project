				<p>The Queer'd Playlist Project was started as an initiative to spread the voices of queer musicians, artists, and bands to like-minded queer folk seeking art, music, and sounds created from the points of view and perspectives inherent to our own existences in this at times strange and unfamiliar world. <p>

				The Queer'd Playlist Project spans many genres and is by no means all-inclusive, nor is it striving to be so. The QPP acts as a catered playlist of musical content created by the LGBT community, but it is also catered to my personal tastes of what I see as exciting, cutting edge, groundbreaking, fresh, and new. The QPP seeks to highlight less-well-known and underground bands alongside more popular and familiar queer musicians. <p>

				I hope these songs make you feel a little more at home.</p>
